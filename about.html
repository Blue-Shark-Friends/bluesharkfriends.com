<h2>About</h2>
<div>
  Blue Shark Friends is a technology consulting and software development company that in many ways is part of the post-pandemic small business boom, but our story is rooted in more than just a reaction to the evolving economic pressures at large.
  <br /><br />
  Our commitment to making software for trans people is drawn from our experiences as disabled trans women fighting to survive the current cissexist regime.
  <br /><br />
  We feel that the key to surviving these times is to strengthen the bonds within our community. We want to be more than a business&#x2013;we want to build a network of trans enterprises that reflects and reinforces our chosen family.
  <br /><br />
  If you&#x0027;re interested, we invite you to get to know us a little better.

  This isn&#x0027;t enough space for me to tell you who I am.  Since I&#x0027;m the Principal Business Analyst and co-founder, I think it&#x0027;s better if I show you.

  I&#x0027;m the Principal Software Engineer and a co-founder of Blue Shark Friends. I&#x0027;m not sure where to start with my story, honestly. I don&#x0027;t have a clean timeline to what brought me here today.

I&#x0027;ve been a professional software engineer for over a decade, but I&#x0027;ve been embedded in tech development since early childhood. I&#x0027;ve been out to everyone as trans since 2019, but I&#x0027;ve been out to my immediate family since 2013. I just got diagnosed with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome in 2023, but in many ways disability has been a part of my life for much longer than I realized. Sometimes it feels like I have to tell my whole life story for anything about me to make sense. 
<br /><br />
Since it&#x0027;s too late for me to spare you the Spider-Man style rant, I might as well also say that I&#x0027;m a sci-fi/fantasy nerd, and I spend a lot of my spare time writing out details about my favorite works of fiction just to structure my thoughts about them.
<br /><br />
Blue Shark Friends is important to me, first and foremost, because I need it. After the past three years of hell in my old job just to be pushed out after asking for accommodations, I need to be doing something for my people. This is the way I believe I can do that. But also, I think our community needs it.
<br /><br />
My situation is not all that unique for a trans person. Many of my friends are in similar straits or worse. A lot of folks have already turned to self-employment, and technology is an unavoidable lifeline. I know we can help folks out with our background, and I believe we have to. We need to be a true community&#x2013;directing our energies and skills into each other as much as possible.
